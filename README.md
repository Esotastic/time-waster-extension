Time Waster is a Chrome extension that helps facilitate those moments at work where you need to blank out and stare at your screen for a while, but you also need to look like you're still doing some work. 

Time Waster will occasionally pop up some modals reminding you to click around, sigh loudly, mutter a buzzword or two under your breath and type something into a text box. 

Time Waster takes no responsibility for any lost jobs.
